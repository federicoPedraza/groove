# Groove `0.1.0` — Feature Overview

Groove `0.1.0` is a desktop workspace orchestrator built with **Tauri + React** for managing multi-worktree development flows, local dev servers, and diagnostics from one interface.

## What Groove does

Groove helps you:

- Open a project workspace and persist it between sessions
- Discover and manage `.worktrees` entries
- Start, stop, restore, and remove worktrees safely
- Run and monitor testing environments tied to specific worktrees
- Inspect and clean up local development processes
- Customize terminal behavior for launching worktree sessions

---

## Core experience

### 1) Workspace lifecycle

- Pick a workspace with a native folder picker
- Persist active workspace metadata in `.groove/workspace.json`
- Restore the last active workspace on app restart
- Track workspace changes via event updates (with refresh fallback)

### 2) Worktree management

From the dashboard, each worktree can be:

- **Restored/Repaired** (via `groove restore`)
- **Played/Opened** (via `groove go`)
- **Stopped** (runtime/process stop)
- **Cut/Removed** (safe delete flow with force fallback handling)

Each worktree exposes status labels such as:

- `ready`
- `closing`
- `paused`
- `corrupted`

### 3) Testing environments

Groove includes per-worktree testing controls:

- Mark worktrees as testing targets
- View selected targets in a dedicated panel
- Start or stop testing sessions per target
- Launch test runs in separate terminal contexts when needed

### 4) Diagnostics & cleanup

The Diagnostics page provides operational visibility:

- List active Opencode instances
- Detect likely Node apps running from worktree paths
- Stop individual processes
- Run stop-all cleanup actions for Opencode and worktree Node processes
- Inspect top memory-consuming programs

### 5) Terminal customization

In Settings, users can configure how worktrees launch:

- Default terminal mode (`auto`, `ghostty`, `warp`, `kitty`, `gnome`, `xterm`, `none`, `custom`)
- Custom command templates with `{worktree}` or `GROOVE_WORKTREE`

## Architecture highlights

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

- Route-based pages:
  - Dashboard (`/`)
  - Diagnostics (`/diagnostics`)
  - Settings (`/settings`)
- Sidebar navigation + mobile-friendly collapsible menu
- Floating command history panel with live and persisted command logs

### Backend (Rust/Tauri commands)

Groove exposes command endpoints for:

- Workspace open/restore/clear and settings updates
- Worktree listing, restore/new/remove/stop operations
- Testing environment status, target selection, start/stop
- Process diagnostics and cleanup operations

It also includes:

- Sidecar binary resolution with `GROOVE_BIN` override support
- Input validation for paths, worktree names, relative paths, and PIDs
- Process safety checks and constrained command execution patterns

---

## Reliability and safety posture in `0.1.0`

This release emphasizes guarded local operations:

- Validated command inputs before execution
- Known-worktree checks and safe token constraints
- Explicit process targeting for diagnostics actions
- Persistent workspace/runtime metadata for recoverability
- Event-driven updates with polling snapshot fallback

---

## Who this release is for

`0.1.0` is ideal for developers who:

- Use multiple worktrees in parallel
- Need quick local environment control without terminal context-switching
- Want a desktop control plane for process hygiene and test orchestration

---

## At-a-glance summary

- **Desktop-first** worktree orchestration
- **One-click** restore/play/stop/remove flows
- **Integrated** testing target and runtime controls
- **Built-in** diagnostics for process cleanup
- **Configurable** terminal launch behavior
- **Validated** backend command surface for safer local automation

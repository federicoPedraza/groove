# Groove `0.1.1` — Git & GitHub Compatibility Update

`0.1.1` improves how Groove works with Git/GitHub workflows across worktrees, settings, and backend command handling.

## Highlights

- Added worktree-focused Git actions so common repository operations run more reliably from the correct worktree context.
- Updated workspace settings/connectivity behavior to better support Git and GitHub-linked environments.
- Expanded backend command support for both `git` and `gh` flows used by the app.
- Improved handling for deleted or missing worktrees to avoid stale state and reduce failed actions.
- Updated telemetry and workspace metadata so Git/GitHub activity and context are tracked more accurately.

## Why this matters

This release makes daily branch and worktree operations smoother, especially in repos that rely on both local Git commands and GitHub CLI integration.

## Short release notes

- Worktree Git actions now run in the right context more consistently, so common repo tasks fail less often.
- GitHub integration is more reliable across local Git and `gh` CLI workflows used in real projects.
- Workspace state now recovers better when worktrees are deleted or missing, reducing stale or broken actions.

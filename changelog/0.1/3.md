Groove 0.1.3 — Diagnostics, Workspace Commands & Setup Automation
0.1.3 focuses on operational visibility, safer workspace automation, and smoother setup across platforms, while continuing to tighten Groove’s desktop workflow for multi-worktree development.
Highlights
- Added a diagnostics system sidebar with host/platform/CPU/memory/disk-style metrics.
- Added an optional setting to always show the diagnostics sidebar outside the Diagnostics page.
- Grouped processes by worktree and improved per-worktree cleanup for OpenCode and Node apps.
- Expanded settings for workspace command templates, testing ports, symlink path management, and new behavior toggles.
- Shipped cross-platform setup automation scripts with sidecar checks, plus README and package script updates.
- Expanded the Tauri/backend command surface to support these new flows end to end.
What changed
1) Diagnostics and process controls
- Introduced a diagnostics sidebar that surfaces host/platform and system resource snapshots (CPU, memory, disk style metrics).
- Added an “Always show diagnostics sidebar” option so the sidebar can remain visible outside /diagnostics.
- Improved process organization by grouping runtime entries by worktree context.
- Added stronger per-worktree cleanup behavior for OpenCode and Node app processes.
- Added a .gitignore sanity check in diagnostics with an apply-patch flow.
2) Settings and workspace configuration
- Expanded settings with workspace command template configuration.
- Added testing port configuration options.
- Added symlink path management UI for workspace-related paths.
- Added/updated toggles including Disable monkey and Always show diagnostics sidebar.
3) Navigation and interface polish
- Refreshed navigation and shell UX for clearer flow across core pages.
- Added mascot sprite state updates to better reflect app state.
- Refined command history behavior and toast UX for clearer feedback and reduced friction.
4) Setup automation and platform support
- Added cross-platform setup automation scripts to streamline local environment preparation.
- Added sidecar checks as part of setup/validation flows.
- Updated README and package scripts to align with the new setup path and command surface.
5) Backend/Tauri command expansion
- Expanded backend/Tauri commands to support diagnostics actions, settings growth, cleanup controls, and setup automation flows.
- Aligned frontend flows with the expanded command surface for more consistent behavior across pages.
Reliability and safety improvements
- Hardened path restrictions to reduce unsafe file/path operations.
- Added command template validation to catch invalid workspace command patterns earlier.
- Added request-id tracing to improve action observability and troubleshooting.
- Applied async stale-guard patterns to reduce race-condition style UI/state drift.
- Bounded command/history retention to prevent unbounded growth and stale noise.
Known limitations
- Some diagnostics metrics are Linux-oriented and may be unavailable or reduced on other operating systems.
- Setup automation still expects Node and Rust toolchains to be preinstalled.
- Existing packaging limitations remain in this release.
At-a-glance summary
- Diagnostics-first visibility with a reusable sidebar and optional always-on behavior
- Cleaner runtime control through worktree-grouped process handling and targeted cleanup
- Broader settings coverage for templates, ports, symlink paths, and behavior toggles
- Smoother UX flow with navigation refresh, mascot state polish, and better history/toast behavior
- Safer command execution via stronger validation, tracing, stale guards, and bounded history
- Faster onboarding through cross-platform setup automation and sidecar verification
